ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Dilallo!

I'm currently a Third-year computer science student with Junior level standing who aspires to become a software developer. As a computer science student at DePaul University, I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. With a solid foundation in programming languages and a passion for problem-solving, I am well-equipped to tackle complex projects and develop innovative solutions.

My time at DePaul has taught me not only technical skills but also valuable collaboration and communication skills. Through coursework and group projects, I have honed my ability to work effectively with others and adapt to new situations. Additionally, through my involvement in the executive board of our school's Computer Science Society as well as the creation of multiple personal projects, I have been able to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and develop a strong portfolio.

Looking to the future, I am eager to continue learning and growing in the field of computer science. Whether it's through internships, research projects, or collaborations with other professionals, I am always excited to explore new avenues for growth and development.
